## General Information
Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.


## Conclusions
 *   Best training accuracy 95.61
 *   Best validation accuracy 91.59
 *   Both overfitting and underfitting issues are resolved
 *   Class rebalance solved underfitting issue
 *   Good training and validation accuracy
 *   Good model to move into production
